## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Manipulating SVGs

- Rounded SVG corners

- SVG scaling

I learned about utilizing SVGs as images rather than directly as an inline SVG, which allowed me to add a style tag in order to round out the corners of the SVG.

I also gained more practice with the eternal struggle of doing something very simple such as centering a div on a page.

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable manipulating elements exactly how I want them through more repetition and exposure to new challenges to solve.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - How to Scale SVG](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/) - This helped me see the difference between my code and correct implementation of a properly scaling SVG.
